### üöÄ **Custom Model: œÜ‚Å¥ + Einstein‚ÄìCartan Torsion Extension**

This fork adds a new model, `lphi4Torsion`, which implements a œÜ‚Å¥ scalar field with:

* An additional dynamical torsion field,
* Tunable mass (`mTorsion`) and quartic self-interaction (`lambdaT`) for torsion,
* Local Einstein‚ÄìCartan‚Äìinspired coupling between the torsion field and the main scalar field momentum, parameterized by `alpha_torsion`.

**Implementation notes:**

* The new model is located in `src/models/lphi4Torsion.h` and takes three scalar fields: `[phi0, phi1, Torsion]`.
* The local torsion‚Äìmomentum coupling term is implemented as a patch to `src/include/CosmoInterface/evolvers/velocityverlet.h`
  (in `kickScalar()`, for field 0 only).
* See `src/models/parameter-files/lphi4Torsion.in` for an example input file with all torsion-related parameters.

#### **Building with MPI and HDF5 (recommended for large runs & output):**

```bash
cd build
cmake -DHDF5=ON -DMODEL=lphi4Torsion -DMPI=ON ../
bash fetchall.sh MyLibs    # Installs h5f and other dependencies if needed
make cosmolattice
```

#### **Running in Parallel**

You can use MPI to run on many CPU cores:

```bash
mpirun --oversubscribe -np 16 ./lphi4Torsion input=lphi4Torsion.in save_dir=./
```

> **Note:** Adjust `-np 16` to match the number of CPU cores you want to use.
> **The number of MPI processes (`-np`) should evenly divide your lattice size** (e.g., for `N=64`, use 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64).
> This ensures proper domain decomposition and optimal parallel performance.

**Key new input parameters:**

* `alpha_torsion`: Coupling strength (set to 0 to recover standard œÜ‚Å¥ theory)
* `mTorsion`: Torsion mass parameter
* `lambdaT`: Torsion quartic self-coupling
* `initial_amplitudes`, `initial_momenta`: Now take 3 values: `[phi0, phi1, torsion]`

See the comments in `lphi4Torsion.h` for detailed documentation.

### Basic installation

*Minimal requirements:* `CMake` version 3 or above, `g++` version 5 or above, `fftw3`.

```
git clone https://github.com/cosmolattice/cosmolattice.git
cd cosmolattice   
mkdir build                     
cd build                        
cmake -DMODEL=lphi4 ../
make cosmolattice
```

This will compile the ``lphi4`` model. To run it with the default input file, you can do

``
./lphi4 input=../src/models/parameter-files/lphi4.in
``

The above commands just represent a very brief guide for the installation and execution of CosmoLattice. 
For further information, see  Appendix A of the <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01031.pdf target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >user-manual</a>.
All options of CosmoLattice, as well as how to activate them and how to install the optional external 
libraries are explained at length there.
